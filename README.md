#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications.
Software engineering ensures that software works well, runs smoothly, and is safe to use. Testing and regular updates help prevent problems that could be expensive or cause serious issues.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software Engineering is Born (1968)

The term "software engineering" was first used to solve problems in software development, like delays and high costs. This marked the start of more organized ways to build software.
Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)

New programming methods, like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), made it easier to create and manage software. Languages like C++ and Java helped developers build bigger and better programs.
Agile Development (2001-Present)

In 2001, Agile methods changed how software was made by focusing on teamwork, flexibility, and quick updates. This made software development faster and more efficient.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Decide what the software should do and how to build it.
Requirements Gathering – Collect all the details about what users need.
Design – Create a plan for how the software will look and work.
Coding – Developers write the actual program.
Testing – Check for mistakes and fix any errors.
Deployment – Release the software for people to use.
Maintenance – Update and improve the software over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
✅ Use Waterfall for:

Building a banking system (security and rules must be clearly defined).
Government projects (strict guidelines and approvals needed).
Developing medical software (high accuracy and regulatory compliance required).
✅ Use Agile for:



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1️⃣ Software Developer

Writes code to build software.
Fixes bugs and improves performance.
Works with designers to make user-friendly apps.
2️⃣ Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

Tests the software to find bugs.
Makes sure everything works well and is easy to use.
Helps developers fix problems before release.
3️⃣ Project Manager (PM)

Leads the team and keeps the project on track.
Plans tasks and deadlines.
Communicates with developers, testers, and clients.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
An IDE is a tool that helps developers write and test code. It includes a code editor, tools to fix errors, and features to make coding easier.

Why IDEs are Important:
Makes coding faster by helping with auto-completion and fixing mistakes.
Helps find and fix bugs easily.
Keeps code organized and easy to manage.
Examples of IDEs:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A simple but powerful tool for coding.
IntelliJ IDEA – Great for Java and Kotlin coding.
Eclipse – Used for Java and C++ projects.
Version Control Systems (VCS)
A VCS keeps track of all changes made to code, so developers can work together without messing things up.

Why VCS are Important:
Keeps track of all code changes so you can go back to previous versions.
Helps multiple people work together without overwriting each other’s work.
Protects your code by storing it safely.
Examples of VCS:
Git – The most popular tool, used with GitHub and GitLab.
Subversion (SVN) – Used in larger projects.
Mercurial – Another tool for tracking changes.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge: Bugs and errors are a normal part of coding, but they can be frustrating and time-consuming to fix.
Strategy:
Write unit tests to catch errors early.
Use debugging tools to track down and fix bugs.
Take breaks and come back with a fresh mind when stuck.
2️⃣ Managing Time and Deadlines

Challenge: Software engineers often have tight deadlines and must juggle multiple tasks at once.
Strategy:
Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
Use time management tools like Trello or Jira to track progress.
Prioritize tasks based on importance and deadlines.
3️⃣ Handling Complex Codebases

Challenge: Large projects with complex code can be hard to understand, especially when joining an ongoing project.
Strategy:
Spend time understanding the project's structure and design.
Ask for documentation and notes from previous developers.
Use comments in your own code for better clarity.
4️⃣ Staying Up-to-Date with Technology

Challenge: Technology is always changing, and software engineers must keep learning new tools and languages.
Strategy:
Dedicate time to learn new skills regularly.
Follow online courses and tutorials to stay updated.
Join developer communities to share knowledge and resources.
5️⃣ Collaboration and Communication Issues


Challenge: Delivering high-quality software that is secure, reliable, and user-friendly can be difficult, especially under time pressure.
Strategy:
Write automated tests to check for issues.
Peer review code with other team members.
Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing

What it is: Testing small parts of the code (like a function) to make sure they work.
Why it matters:
Catches bugs early.
Makes sure each part works as it should.
2 Integration Testing

What it is: Testing how different parts of the software work together.
Why it matters:
Ensures the parts work well together.
Finds problems when combining features.
3 System Testing

What it is: Testing the entire software to make sure everything works together.
Why it matters:
Ensures the whole system functions correctly.
Checks if all parts work as expected when put together.
4 Acceptance Testing

What it is: Testing to see if the software meets the customer’s needs and requirements.
Why it matters:
Confirms the software is ready to be used.
Makes sure it satisfies customer expectations.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs (prompts) given to an AI model to get the best possible output. The goal is to ask the right questions or provide clear instructions to guide the AI toward providing useful, relevant, and accurate responses.

Better Results

The way a prompt is worded can significantly affect the quality of the AI's response. A well-constructed prompt helps the AI understand what you're asking and generate more accurate answers.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
